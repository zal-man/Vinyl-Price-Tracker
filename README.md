# Vinyl Price Tracker

## What this is
This project is for people who want to own records, not optimize them.

There’s a large, mostly silent group of vinyl buyers who:
- Care about music first, format second
- Get paralyzed by Discogs-level versioning
- Are price-sensitive without being deep bargain hunters
- Want to make sane buying decisions without spreadsheets

They’re not anti-vinyl.
They’re anti-decision-fatigue.

Discogs is incredible for collectors, sellers, and archivists.
Popsike is invaluable for historical pricing.
eBay, Amazon, Mercari, Walmart and other marketplaces are where transactions actually happen.

This project lives in the gap between them, focusing on plain-English signals like:
- “Is this overpriced?”
- “Should I wait?”
- “What’s a reasonable price for a decent copy?”

It’s an experiment in reducing UX debt in vinyl pricing and helping people buy records with confidence — without stripping the joy out of collecting.
